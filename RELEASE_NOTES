                    1.3.8 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.8 release cycle, from the 1.3.8rc1 release to the 1.3.8 maintenance
releases.  More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and
ChangeLog files.

1.3.8rc1
---------

  + Minimum DH parameter size for TLS has been raised from 1024 to 2048.

  + Fixed occasional segfaults with FTPS data transfers using TLSv1.3, when
    session tickets cannot be decrypted (Issue #1063).

  + Fixed memory use-after-free issue in mod_sftp which can cause unexpected
    login/authentication issues.

  * Set the `OPENSSL_API_COMPAT` API version compatibility macro.  We currently
    set our OpenSSL API version to 1.0.0 and later; code which uses an OpenSSL
    API earlier than 1.0.0 will cause the build to fail.  Use the new
    `--disable-openssl-api-compat` configure option to disable use of this
    macro.

  + Fixed SQL syntax regression for some generated SQL statements
    (Issue #1149).


  + Deprecated Directives

    MultilineRFC2228
      This directive has caused many issues unexpectedly, particularly for
      responses of the FEAT command, and is not necessary.


  + New Directives

    ListStyle
      This directive is used to emit Windows-style directory listings, for
      compatibility with certain FTP clients.  See
      doc/modules/mod_ls.html#ListStyle for more information.

    RedisLogFormatExtra
      This directive supports adding custom key/values to the JSON logging
      done by the RedisLogOnCommand, RedisLogOnEvent directives.  See
      doc/modules/mod_redis.html#RedisLogFormatExtra for details.


  + Changed Directives

    RedisServer
      Redis 6.x changed its AUTH command, due to the Redis ACL system, for
      supporting multiple users.  Thus the `RedisServer` directive now takes
      a username, as well as a password.  The Redis server version is auto-
      detected; the configured username will be ignored for Redis servers
      older than Redis 6.x.

    TLSCipherSuite
      TLSv1.3 ciphersuites have different names, and are configured differently
      in OpenSSL.  To support configuration of TLSv1.3 ciphersuites, the
      `TLSCipherSuite` directive takes an optional protocol specifier; see
      the documentation for details.

    TLSOptions
      Support for the long-deprecated `NoCertRequest` TLSOption has been
      removed.

      New `AllowWeakSecurity` TLSOption added (Issue #1048)
